Alhamdullilah, completed another full stack project as 'Student Portal' with Python | Django Backend and Bootstrap | Custom CSS for the frontend.

This is very familiar to a Google classroom with similar functionalities.

Some of the features include:

1. Proper authentication functionalities like signup , login , change password etc.
2. As a course instructor, you can create/edit courses with relevant categories.
   A news feed of every course where you can make announcements. You can can create/edit pages , quizzes and assignment for your course and monitor submissions of students and grade them.
3. As a student , you can go through all the courses created by teachers , get enrolled in them and access all the relevant material of the course. Take quizzes and assignments and view pages and then the teacher will grade your submissions.
4. A direct messaging system where you can message any user (student or teacher).
5. An Q&A system (course-wise) which follows the Stack overflow methodology of up voting and down voting of answers. The answers get priority based on this data.

There's so much more in the application than what I have stated here.
I invite you to play around with the application on this link https://student-portal-production.up.railway.app/.
NOTE: This project was made with the help of Lara Code (YouTube Channel).
